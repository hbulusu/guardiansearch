This app searches Guardian news by tags and displays all the articles. I created this app while learning basics of Google App Engine. The app can be accessed from http://hc-guardiansearch.appspot.com/. 
It was an exercise to understand APIs and Google App Engine.
To test the app, enter a tag such as technology, media, world. I have used http://content.guardianapis.com/tags?page-size=50&type=all to determine what tags are used at Guardian to execute the search. Example tags - media, commentisfree, technology, world.
